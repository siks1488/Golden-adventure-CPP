# Golden-adventure-CPP
**Version 1.0.1** <br>
Golden adventure is a game made in c++ without GUI, where it was based on fighting monsters in a cave. You will start with a certain amount of gold and with that amount of gold you can go to the shop to buy hp or attack to defeat the monsters in the cave.


Golden adventure is still in the alpha stage! Because I'm at the beginning with C++ I've been learning for 2 days and I'm not that good at it. Maybe in the future if I learn how to make a graphic interface I'll apply it to this game


**How do I make it work?** <br>
To make it work you must have an ide (for example: visual studio code), if you have installed or have an ide 
you can open that ide and drag the Golden Adventure folder into it and then you can give it run from the ide

**News from alpha version 1.0.1:** <br>
Alpha version 1.0.1 includes changes to the code to make it shorter and remove unnecessary code,
I added the armor mechanism and modified some dragon and slime codes to introduce the armor system.
